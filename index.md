# Received a card?

Well, that sucks. It means that a customer of yours wanted to pay you using the best money humanity ever had, and you refused it. Ooof.

Here is what you can do:

- Learn about the benefits of accepting sats<br/>
  <small>TLDR: Near 0% transaction fees, near-instant settlement, no chargebacks.</small>
- [Understand why][wtf] the money you received is a shitcoin
- [Set yourself up][local] to receive sats
- [Follow the white rabbit! üêá][br]

# Want to shame someone else?

Go ahead! Download one of the PDFs below and print it yourself. The cards are business-card-sized, so it should be easy enough. Also: feel free to translate them, remix them, and make them your own!
