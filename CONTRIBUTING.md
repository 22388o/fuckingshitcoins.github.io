## Contributing to fuckingshitcoins.com

Hey, thanks for taking the time to contribute! You're awesome! ðŸŽ‰

The goal of [fuckingshitcoins.com](https://fuckingshitcoins.com)
is to shame people into mass-adoption. It's a very serious project.

### Adding a Translation

- Have a look at the [`/files/pdfs/`][pdfs] folder
- Create your own version, using a tool like [Inkscape]
- Add your version to the folder via a [pull request][pr]
- That's it!

Feel free to be creative! Fonts are in the [fonts folder][fonts], in case you're
missing some.
